# Human-Emotions-Reaction-Recognition-System
One of the important ways humans display emotions is through facial expressions. Facial expression recognition is one of the most powerful, natural and immediate means for human beings to communicate their emotions and intensions. Humans can be in some circumstances restricted from showing their emotions, such as hospitalized patients, or due to deficiencies; hence, better recognition of other human emotions will lead to effective communication.
